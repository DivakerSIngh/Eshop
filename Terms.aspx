<b style="color:blue;font-size:x-large;">Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</b><br />
<b>Overview<br />
Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Villagers. However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Villagers, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.<br />
What is a 'dispute'?<br />
A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Website.<br />
How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?<br />
Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.<br />
It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.<br />
How is a 'dispute' created?<br />
Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to dispute@Villagers.com, while the Seller can write to ss@Villagers.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.<br />
What are the various types of 'disputes'?<br />
Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:<br />
1. Wrong item received<br />
2. Item Not as described<br />
•	Damaged or Seal broken on Product<br />
•	Part/Accessory missing<br />
•	Item not Compatible<br />
•	Seller Description/Specification Wrong<br />
•	Defective (Functional issues)<br />
•	Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice<br />
In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Villagers will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.<br />

<b style="color:blue;font-size:x-large;">Disputes (Resolutions) Policy</b><br />
<b>Overview<br />
Generally, transactions are conducted smoothly on Villagers. However there may be some cases where both the Buyers and Sellers may face issues. At Villagers, we have a Dispute Resolution process in order to resolve disputes between Buyers and Sellers.<br />
What is a 'dispute'?,<br />
A 'Dispute' can be defined as a disagreement between a Buyer and a Seller in connection with a transaction on the Website.<br />
How does a 'dispute' occur in the Marketplace?<br />
Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.<br />
It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until the issue is resolved.<br />
How is a 'dispute' created?<br />
Whenever there is a disagreement, the Buyer can write to dispute@Villagers.com, while the Seller can write to ss@Villagers.com, in order to raise a dispute. Disputes can be raised at a particular transaction level.<br />
What are the various types of 'disputes'?<br />
Following are the indicative examples of potential disputes:<br />
1. Wrong item received<br />
2. Item Not as described<br />
•	Damaged or Seal broken on Product<br />
•	Part/Accessory missing<br />
•	Item not Compatible<br />
•	Seller Description/Specification Wrong<br />
•	Defective (Functional issues)<br />
•	Product not working and Manufacturer claims invalid Invoice<br />
In case the Seller rejects the return request of the Buyer, and Buyer raises a dispute, then Villagers will try to mediate and resolve the dispute between both the parties. If the dispute is resolved in favour of the Buyer, a refund is provided once the product is returned to the Seller. If the dispute is settled in favour of the Seller, Buyer is entitled to any refund.<br />
 <br /></b>
<b style="color:blue;font-size:x-large;">Buyer Protection Program</b>
<b>In case of a dispute where the Seller is unable to provide a refund or a replacement, Villagers will actively work towards reaching a resolution.<br />
The Buyer Protection Program covers Buyers who are unable to successfully resolve their dispute with the Seller or are not satisfied the resolution provided by the Seller.<br />
The Buyer can write to resolution@Villagers.com if the issue with the Seller is not resolved. Villagers's Customer Support team will look into the case to check for possible fraud and if the Buyer has been blacklisted/blocked from making purchases on the Website. Only after verifying these facts, a dispute can be registered.<br />
In due course of resolution, Villagers's Customer Support Team will facilitate a conference call including the Seller and the Buyer.<br />
When a dispute has been raised, Villagers may provide both the parties access to each others Display Names, contact details including email addresses and other details pertaining to the dispute. Buyers and Sellers are subject to final consent from Villagers for settling the dispute.<br />
